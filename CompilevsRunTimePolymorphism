	-Give real example of below used in project
  -polymorphism:
      -Run time binding:
              -code will be ecuting
              -user will give option,function will set the variable
              -Excutable file already generated
      -compile time binding,
              -this can not achived by run time functionality
              -need macro
              -Macro  defined in  some file ,and in op file file it set true or false
              -Befor genrating(.exe) excutable file condition are checked
  ====================================================================================
	1-Sim Selection[Run time bindin ]
			-Sim1 or Sim2
			-Only one line
			-User Give Input

			-Compile time both code will be compiled
			-present in excutable ,based on user input ,given code will be excute
			-Function will be called here to  change the status
			-run time polymorphism
	2.Specific code on specific target[compile time binding]
	        -It use macro flag ,which define in  operation file(op) and checked by make file at compilation
			-[this code]run on target1 not target2
			-if target1
			    code compile and run on system
		    -else
		    	code does not compile and not excute on system,

			-Above things called compile time polymorphism
			-Run time polymorphism will not help here,because hardware flag is set by user in op for which
			 target  has to be happen at compile time ,befor excutable generation,
