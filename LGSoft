         -C++,STL
         -Write always clean and smooth.

1.Tell Me about your self
2.How Much you rate urself in c++ and C/  C-6/C++7
3.What is difference b/w deep copy and shallow copy
       -shallow copy and  deep copy both are  used to copy new object          
4.Distructure can be virtual?
5.Dimond problem?

6.  A->B[virtual]->C->D->E
7.  Class A
    {
         int a;
         int b;
         static int c;
    };

                 -object copying
          -diffrence b/w factory method and abstact factory
          -Give code snippet for factory method
